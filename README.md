## Easy Doctor frontend

### Summary

<p>Easy Doctor is an app that you can use to find different doctors and make appointments with them. Appointments can be held on-site or online through the Zoom platform. You can also leave reviews for your doctor or clinic. You can add information about yourself and view your profile and depending on what type of user you are you can view other users profile</p>
<p>This repo is for the frontend of the project, which was done using ReactJs, redux, CSS and I used Vercel to deploy it.</p>
